Tool for editing wands in Noita

https://orifawas.github.io/noita_savefile_wand_edit/

## Usage

1. Click **Load player.xml** and select your Noita save (`%AppData%/LocalLow/Nolla_Games_Noita/save00/player.xml`).
2. Switch between wand tabs to inspect each equipped wand.
3. Edit stat fields or toggle shuffle to adjust wand behavior.
4. Drag spells from the library into wand slots, or drag between slots to reorder. Remove a spell with the `×` hover button.
5. Click **Download edited XML** to save the modified file, then replace the original (after backing it up!).

## Important – Back Up Your Save

Before making any changes, create a backup of your entire save folder (save00). Simply copy the folder to a safe location. Editing save files incorrectly can corrupt your save or cause unexpected behavior in-game. If something goes wrong, you can restore your backup and try again safely.
